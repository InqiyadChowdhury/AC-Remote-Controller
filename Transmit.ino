#include <IRremote.h>
This line includes the IRremote library, which allows you to send infrared signals with your Arduino.

IRsend irsend;
This line creates an IRsend object, which is used to send infrared signals.

void setup() {
 Serial.begin(9600);
}
The setup() function is called once when the Arduino starts up. In this function, we initialize the Serial monitor so that we can print debug messages to it.

void loop() {
 delay(5000);
The loop() function is called repeatedly while the Arduino is running. In this function, we start with a 5-second delay.

 //power//
 irsend.sendNEC(0x38863BD2, 32); //power Code
 Serial.println("power");
Next, we send the NEC power code to the IR transmitter. This will turn the device off. We then print "power" to the Serial monitor.

 delay(5000);
We then wait for another 5 seconds.

 for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  irsend.sendNEC(0x38843BF2, 32); 
  Serial.println("Power On");
  delay(250);
 }
In this for loop, we send the NEC power on code 5 times. This will turn the device on. We print "Power On" to the Serial monitor after each transmission. We also wait for 250 milliseconds between each transmission.

 delay(5000);
We then wait for another 5 seconds.

 for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  irsend.sendNEC(0x38863BC2, 32); //
  Serial.println("Power Off");
  delay(250);
 }
In this for loop, we send the NEC power off code 5 times. This will turn the device off. We print "Power Off" to the Serial monitor after each transmission. We also wait for 250 milliseconds between each transmission.

This code will continuously turn the device on and off every 5 seconds. You can modify the code to send different infrared codes to control different devices. You can also modify the code to send the codes at different intervals.
